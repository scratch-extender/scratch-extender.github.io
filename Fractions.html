<p style="background-color:#d000ff; color:#f4fc03;">A fraction is a part of a whole. It is made of 2 parts, a numerator and a denominator. In standard form it is written like :-<br>
5<br>
â€”<br>
6<br>
However we will write it as 5/6.
The top part is known as the numerator. It represents how many parts of the whole we are talking about. The numerator of this fraction is 5. The bottom part is known as the denominator. It represents how many parts of the whole are there in total. The denominator of this fraction is 6. Think of it this way, you order a pizza with 6 slices. You eat 5. So 5 / 6 or five sixths of the pizza are in your stomach. However, it is important to note that all the parts have to be equal. So, if you cut the pizza in such a way that it has 1 small slice and 1 big slice, and then eat one of the slices, you can't say you ate 1 / 2 of the pizza. Also a fraction cannot have 0 as the denominator, so 5 / 0 is basically undefined. And the numerator and the denominator have to be whole numbers (But the denominator cannot be 0). There are different types and ways of writing a fraction.
